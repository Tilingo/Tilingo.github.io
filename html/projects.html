							In 2017, I took the Front End Development course at General Assembly.<br><br>
							This website was my final project for the course. <br><br>
							I built a portfolio site to show my work. <br><br>
							This website is a study of parallax, where some objects move at different speeds when you
							scroll down. Some other objects show themselves when you reach a certain point on the
							website. <br><br>
							One year later, I decided to build another portfolio site, but in this case, I used grid and
							position as my study subjects.

							I grew up using one of these things... <br><br>
							I am a former Chemistry student, and I used to use these calculators on a daily basis.
							So when they told us to build a calculator, I knew I wanted to build a scientific one.
							<br><br>
							In this project I did a study of Javascript Math. With this powerful method I was
							able to give my calculator the mathematical power that it needed. <br><br>
							The colors resemble the periodic table, but actually, that was a nice coincidence.

							I've used Star Wars already, so I needed to do something different...<br><br>
							As a teenager I was obsessed with the work of the Wachowski Brothers. The Matrix was a
							revolution, and V for Vendetta was epic.<br><br>
							So I decided to use V for Vendetta as my second announcement website.<br><br>
							I was looking for a super clean look, focusing on using the black and red colors from the
							movie's main character, V.<br><br>
							I built this website entirely using flex box, wanting to put into practice that technique.

							We were asked to make an announcement website for a movie...<br><br>
							I don't remember when I started to enjoy Star Wars, so basically it's been around me my
							whole life.<br><br>
							This was the first project of the Codebridge program.<br><br>
							At this point, we knew very little about positioning techniques. So making this website look
							nice was a challenge.<br><br>
							I used full pictures as my background for some sections, and I tried to be consistent with
							the colors. I used the blue and yellow from the iconic font from the movies.

							This one wasn't as fun as it is to play...<br><br>
							Actually, it was fun, but it was a challenge.<br><br>
							We were asked to build an animation using javascript setInterval() function.<br><br>
							I came up with this "game" that is a litle bit hard to play. You are supposed to click the
							ball, and every time you click, your score goes up by 1. But, when the ball goes down, it
							also goes faster, which makes clicking on it way more difficult.

							For this one I didn't need to design...<br><br>

							For this project they gave us a photoshop file with all the content already there. Our job
							was to make it happen.<br><br>

							It was nice to just focus on the development, making sure that the final project was as
							close to the original design as possible.<br><br>

							This website was completely done using flexbox.

							Wordpress is different..<br><br>
							This was my actual first real project as a web developer.<br><br>
							I built this in combination with a web designer.<br><br>
							This website is built on Worpdress - something completely different from what I had learned
							before.<br><br>
							Wordpress is supposed to be super friendly for people who don't know how to code, but it
							still requires a lot of learning and time to build something like this one.<br><br>
							This is an eCommerce website for a book.
